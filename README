This repository contains everything needed to create the Concerto Debian package.

To update/build the package:
Make sure the required tools are installed (gpg,lintian, and reprepro)
Make sure the GPG keychain (available from a committer) is installed in your home directory (you'll also need the passphrase for the key)
Run the ./build_deb_package.sh script
Upload the packages.tar.gz that results to the download server and unpack it

To use the package from the Concerto-Signage repository:
Use the add_concerto_repo.sh script and then run sudo apt-get install concerto
OR
Add the concerto-signage repository key: 
wget -O - http://dl.concerto-signage.org/concerto_deb_public.key | sudo apt-key add -
Add this line to /etc/apt.sources.list (or as a file in  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/):
 deb http://dl.concerto-signage.org/packages/ precise main

After installation, the Concerto Apache configuration must be enabled (sudo a2ensite concerto) and Apache restarted (sudo service apache2 reload). The default Apache configuration may also need to be disabled (sudo a2dissite default).

What does the Concerto package install?
The package will place a concerto config file in /etc/apache2/sites-available that includes Passenger and contains a reasonable Concerto vhost configuration

In addition to the dependencies listed below, the Concerto package drops the Concerto source code in /usr/share/concerto and then performs a few post-install tasks:
  Installation of global gem dependencies listed below
  Compilation of Passenger Apache extensions
  bundle install in the vendor/bundle directory of Concerto
  Creation of sqlite-based database.yml in the Concerto config directory
